# DGS Code Jam!
This repository holds all the submissions for DGS Code Jam, an internal coding competition designed to improve Python fluency across our agency. 

## Jam 1: Fiscal Year Function  
Here the idea is to write a function that takes in as input a Pandas DataFrame where at least one column has a dtype of `datetime`. That's Pandas' most common format for representing points in time. Your function should add a column to the Pandas dataframe that tells us what fiscal year the datetime column is in.
